title: Image-based Vehicle Re-identification Model with Adaptive Attention
  Modules and Metadata Re-ranking
date: 2020-08-10T19:48:43.788Z
summary: Vehicle Re-identification is a challenging task due to intra-class
  variability and inter-class similarity across non-overlapping cameras. To
  tackle these problems, recently proposed methods require additional annotation
  to extract more features for false positive image exclusion. In this paper, we
  propose a model powered by adaptive attention modules that requires fewer
  label annotations but still out-performs the previous models. We also include
  a re-ranking method that takes account of the importance of metadata feature
  embeddings in our paper. The proposed method is evaluated on CVPR AI City
  Challenge 2020 dataset and achieves mAP of 37.25% in Track 2.
